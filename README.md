# A-Lot-of-Monkeys

**Idea: **We've all heard the idea that “if you put a thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters in a room for infinity, they would write all of Shakespeare's work.” Now, I want to get an idea of how realistic this is. I mean, monkeys aren't perfectly random, and there might be some keys they hit more than others. So, to test this theory, I will be using a genetic algorithm in Java to test a smaller version— and, of course, not for infinity.
